<strong>
  <Icon name="star" /> Get Started
</strong>

To get started with Cypress Cloud,
[sign up here](https://cloud.cypress.io/signup) for our
[free plan](https://www.cypress.io/pricing) which comes with 3 users and 500
monthly test results.

:::

[Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud) is our enterprise-ready, web-based
companion to the Cypress app. It gives you online access to your recorded test
results, orchestrates test runs across multiple machines, provides rich
analytics and diagnostics, and integrates those insights with your favorite
tools.

The Cypress
[Real World App (RWA)](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app)
leverages [Cypress Cloud in CI](https://cloud.cypress.io/projects/7s5okt) to
test over 300 test cases in parallel across 25 machines, multiple browsers,
multiple device sizes, and multiple operating systems.

Check out the <Icon name="github" />
[Real World App in Cypress Cloud](https://cloud.cypress.io/projects/7s5okt).

## Benefits

### Analyze and diagnose

Each test run is stored in Cypress Cloud, where you can see past results and the
current state of your app on the [Latest Runs](/guides/cloud/debugging/recorded-runs) page. View
each test's
[command logs, screenshots, video replays, stack traces, and CI logs](/guides/cloud/debugging/recorded-runs#Test-detail-sidebar).
Quickly identifying a test failure in CI is just a click away.

<DocsVideo src="https://vimeo.com/806005654" />

### Analyze and diagnose test health

View each [run's overview](/guides/cloud/debugging/recorded-runs#Overview-tab) to see and compare
past runs and analyze trends over time. You can quickly analyze changes in your
setup that might introduce problematic trends as well as identify unreliable
tests with [Flaky Test Management](/guides/cloud/flaky-test-management).

<DocsVideo src="https://vimeo.com/806900039" />

The [analytics](/guides/cloud/analytics) page shows test metrics over time,
helping determine the overall health of your test suite. Quickly see which tests
are problematic, getting slower, or growing over time.

For users of the open-source [Cypress app](/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app),
we've integrated test run information from Cypress Cloud so developers can see
the latest results across the team, and identify areas of concern.

  alt="Runs List"

### Run tests in parallel, in priority order, or not at all

With our [Smart Orchestration](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/overview)
features, you can run tests across a swarm of machines simultaneously while
Cypress Cloud coordinates runners and
[balances test loads](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/load-balancing#Balance-strategy) -
no setup required! You can prioritize recently failed specs with
[Spec Prioritization](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/spec-prioritization) to
surface problems earlier, and cancel whole test runs on failure with
[Auto Cancellation](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/run-cancellation) to save
on resource usage. You can also
[cancel in-progress runs](/guides/cloud/debugging/recorded-runs#Run-cancellation) manually
from Cypress Cloud if you need to.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/dashboard/introduction/orchestration-diagram.png"
  alt="Diagram comparing serial and parallel test configurations"
/>

Cypress Cloud's
[Spec Prioritization](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/spec-prioritization)
lets you prioritize recently failed specs so they run faster on their next run.
The [Auto Cancellation](/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/run-cancellation)
feature will cancel a whole test run on failure, saving time and resource usage.
You can also [cancel in-progress runs](/guides/cloud/debugging/recorded-runs#Run-cancellation)
manually from Cypress Cloud if you need to.

Ensure rock-solid reliability by keeping failing code out of your
[GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) and
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) repositories, with
[status checks](/guides/cloud/integrations/source-control/github#Status-checks)
that block commits from being merged until your Cypress tests are green. Surface
test results directly in your PRs with
[pull request comments](/guides/cloud/integrations/source-control/github#Pull-request-comments)
that include test run statistics, specific failure details, and deep links to
results in Cypress Cloud for fast debugging. Users with
[Business or Enterprise plans](https://www.cypress.io/pricing/) can integrate
securely with
[Self-managed GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/self_managed/)
instances too.

  alt="Status checks per spec"
/>

### Collaborate and organize

We also integrate with two of the world's most popular collaboration tools:
[Slack](https://slack.com/) and [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira).
Deliver test results with valuable additional context, directly into a dedicated
Slack channel. Or for those on the
[Team, Business or Enterprise plans](https://www.cypress.io/pricing/),
[create bidirectionally linked Jira tickets](/guides/cloud/integrations/jira#Creating-a-Jira-issue-for-a-test-case)
directly from specific test failures.

  alt="Cypress notification feed in Slack channel"

#### Issue Management

Keep the whole team up-to-date with [Jira](/guides/cloud/integrations/jira)
integration. You can
[create bidirectionally linked Jira tickets](/guides/cloud/integrations/jira#Creating-a-Jira-issue-for-a-test-case)
directly from specific test failures.

### Cypress app integration

The [Cypress app](/guides/cloud/debugging/recorded-runs#Cypress-App) integrates directly with
Cypress Cloud to provide developers with the latest test results without having
to switch tools.

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/debug-page.png"
  alt="Debug"
/>

### Flexible enterprise configuration and single sign on

You can use our flexible administrative functions to configure Cypress Cloud however you want, grouping
[projects](/guides/cloud/account-management/projects) into multiple
[organizations](/guides/cloud/account-management/organizations) if you have a
lot, checking [usage](/guides/cloud/account-management/billing-and-usage), and
administering
[users and permissions](/guides/cloud/account-management/users#User-roles). We
also provide [SSO integration](/guides/cloud/account-management/enterprise-sso)
for teams on our [Enterprise plan](https://www.cypress.io/pricing/).
